"2. Deaths and population estimates are reported separately for St. Louis City (FIPS code 29510) and county (FIPS code 29189)."
"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"5. The method used to calculate age-adjusted rates is documented here: More information:"
