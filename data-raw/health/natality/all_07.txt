Caveats:
"1. Each birth record represents one living baby."
"2. County-level data are shown only for counties with populations of 100,000 persons or more. Within each state, data for all"
"counties with fewer than 100,000 persons are combined together under the label ""Unidentified Counties."""
"3. For birth weight data shown in WONDER before May 8, 2015, 21 births that occurred in year 2011 were erroneously reported in"
"the birth weight category 5000-8165 grams, instead of the ""Not stated"" birth weight category. These 21 births are now reported"
"in ""Not stated"" birth weight category."
"4. As a result of population changes the following counties do not have data available for all years.<br/> Before 2014 the data"
"for the following counties was recoded to the ""Unidentified Counties"" category within the state of the county because they did"
