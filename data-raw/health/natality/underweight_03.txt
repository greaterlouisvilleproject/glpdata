Caveats:
"1. Each birth record represents one living baby."
"2. County-level data are shown only for counties with populations of 100,000 persons or more. Data for all counties with fewer"
"than 100,000 persons within a state are combined together under the label ""Unidentified Counties."""
"3. The independent city of St. Louis, Missouri (FIPS code 29510) is reported separately from St. Louis county (FIPS code 29189)."
